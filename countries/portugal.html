      <h4>
        Portuguese cuisine has influences from many different countries. Portugal's desserts were traditionally 
        developed in monasteries and have significant external culinary influences. Around the coastline, you will find 
        delicious seafood dishes such as octopus and Bacalhau fish. Portugal is the largest manufacturer of citrus fruits 
        around Europe hence they are a popular ingredient in a variety of pastries. As for the customary 
        culinary practices in Portugal, most enjoy a light breakfast with juice and a pastry. Later on, lunch and 
        dinner are considered the larger meals of the day.

          These very famous Portuguese custard tarts are called Pastéis de Nata. If you are in Libson, 
          you must try one of these delicious pastries at none other than the renowned Pastéis de Belém
          bakery. With a crispy outside and a soft egg custard filling, these pastries are crafted to perfection.
          The best way to eat them is warm and fresh out of the oven, so try to eat them the same day you make them.

          Bacalhau-a-Braz is one of the most popular dishes in Portugal. The cod fish itself is widely used in many Portuguese
          dishes as it has more than 300 recipes with the fish. Bacalhau-a-Braz takes its name from its creator. The dish contains 
          pieces of the cod fish, onions and (in some cases) strings of fries soaked in an egg-based cream. Not all dishes are 
          cooked the same, but they all taste equally as delicious!
