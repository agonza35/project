      <h4>
        French cuisine originates from medieval times. Most of the meals were some form of spiced meats that 
        were salted for preservation such as pork, beef, and fish. Throughout history, french cuisine was dictated 
        by whatever food was in abundance. During the 15th and 16th centuries. the French were influenced by the 
        culinary cuisine of Italy and started making a variety of dishes that used ingredients such as 
        garlic, mushrooms, and truffles. During the 16th and 18th centuries, Paris was considered the center
        of culinary activity and was considered the Ancien Regime. The French Revolution served as a 
        defining moment as it encouraged gourmet specialist to experiment with different ingredients and meals. 
        Today, Haute cooking is extremely popular and emulates a grande cuisine.
