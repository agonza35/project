    <!-- General Greece cuisine info-->
    <h1>Greece</h1>
    <div class="history">
      <h4>
        In common with many other cuisines of the Mediterranean, it is founded on the triad of wheat, olive oil, and wine.
        It uses vegetables, olive oil, grains, fish, and meat, including pork, poultry, veal and beef, lamb, rabbit, and goat. 
        Other important ingredients include pasta (for example hilopites), cheeses, lemon juice, herbs, olives, and yogurt. 
        Bread made of wheat is ubiquitous; other grains, notably barley, are also used, especially for paximathia. 
        Common dessert ingredients include nuts, honey, fruits, and filo pastries. It continues traditions from Ancient Greek and Byzantine cuisine, while incorporating Balkan and Italian influences.
        Greek cuisine uses some flavorings more often than other Mediterranean cuisines do, namely oregano, mint, garlic, onion, dill, cummin, coriander, and bay laurel leaves. Other common herbs and spices include basil, thyme and fennel seed. 
        Parsley is also used as a garnish on some dishes. Many Greek recipes, especially in the northern parts of the country, use "sweet" spices in combination with meat, for example cinnamon, allspice and cloves in stews.

          Greek Salad is a popular salad in Greek cuisine generally made with pieces of tomatoes, cucumbers, onion, feta cheese (usually served as a slice on top of the other ingredients), and olives (typically Kalamata olives) and dressed with salt, Greek oregano, and olive oil. 
          Common additions include green bell pepper slices or caper berries (especially on the Dodecanese islands). Greek salad is often imagined as a farmer's breakfast or lunch, as its ingredients resemble those that a Greek farmer might have on hand.

          Gyros are a food item of Greek origin made from meat cooked on a vertical rotisserie and served wrapped or stuffed in pita bread, along with ingredients such as tomato, onion, fried potatoes, and tzatziki. 
          In Greece, it is normally made with pork or sometimes with chicken.
          For hand-made gyros, meat is cut into approximately round, thin, flat slices, which are then stacked on a spit and seasoned. 
          Fat trimmings are usually interspersed. Spices may include cumin, oregano, thyme, rosemary, and others. 
          The pieces of meat, in the shape of an inverted cone, are placed on a tall vertical rotisserie, which turns slowly in front of a source of heat or broiler. 
          As the cone cooks, lower parts are basted with the juices running off the upper parts. 
          The outside of the meat is sliced vertically in thin, crisp shavings when done.

        <p id="dish-description">
          Souvlaki is a popular Greek fast food consisting of small pieces of meat and sometimes vegetables grilled on a skewer. 
          It is usually eaten straight off the skewer while still hot. It can be served with or inside of a rolled pita, typically with lemon, sauces, vegetables such as sliced tomato and onion, and fried potatoes as a side. 
          The meat usually used in Greece and Cyprus is pork, although chicken, beef, and lamb may also be used there and elsewhere.
