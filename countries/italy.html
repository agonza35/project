      <h4>
        Italian cuisine has been around for over 2000 years and can be traced back to the time of the Roman Empire. 
        While we may associate certain dishes with Italian cuisine, the dishes eaten today have had quite a bit of external influence. 
        For example, traces of Arab cuisine can be found in Sicilian dishes and some ingredients used originated in China. 
        Overall, each region in Italy has its own distinct cooking style and traditional dishes. Naples is famous for its Pizza, 
        Milan for its risotto and Bologna for its torellini.

          A distinctly Tuscan Dish, Pici with Tuscan Ragu sauce is a delicious pasta dish with ground meat. 
          This dish gets its name from the fact that the pasta dough is kneaded by hand and then stretched into long
          thick spaghetti. As classic dish that can be found in Montepulciano, it is a must! Pair with 
          some red wine and add some Pecorino cheese to top it off!

          A classic Roman dish, tonnarelli alla carbonara is a traditional favorite. This simple, yet tasty 
          dish uses tonnarelli pasta, bacon, egg yolks, Pecorino cheese, and some ground peppercorns. If you are
          looking to try a classic tonarelli alla carbonara in Rome, head over to Tonarello located in Trastevere.

          Arguably one of the most recognizable dishes, pizza in Italy is made to perfection! Napoli is 
          known for their Pizza, yet there are a variety of good Pizza restaurants throughout Italy. 
          If you are in the mood for a thick crust, try Sicilian Pizza! Want a crunchy or flat crust, 
          try the Pizza Tonda Romana! Dar Poeta in Trastevere is one of my favorites and highly rated online!  
          If you are looking for a quick take-away pizza, try Alice Pizza!
