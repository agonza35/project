        Italian cuisine has developed over the centuries. Although the country known as Italy did not 
        unite until the 19th century, the cuisine can claim traceable roots as far back as the 4th century BC. 
        Food and culture were very important at that time evident from the cookbook (Apicius) which dates to the 
        first century BC.[28] Through the centuries, neighbouring regions, conquerors, high-profile chefs, political 
        upheaval, and the discovery of the New World have influenced its development. Italian cuisine started to form 
        after the fall of the Roman Empire when different cities began to separate and form their own traditions. 
        Many different types of bread and pasta were made, and there was a variation in cooking techniques and 
        preparation.
        The country was then split for a long time and influenced by surrounding countries such as Spain, France 
        and others in Central Europe. Trade and the location on the Silk Road with its routes to Asia also influenced 
        he local development of special dishes. Due to the climatic conditions and the different proximity to the sea, 
        different basic foods and spices were available from region to region. Regional cuisine is represented by some 
        of the major cities in Italy. For example, Milan (in the north of Italy) is known for risottos, Trieste (in the 
        northeast of Italy) is known for multicultural food, Bologna (in the centre of Italy) is known for its tortellini, 
        and Naples (in the south of Italy) is famous for its pizzas.[29] Spaghetti for example is believed to have spread 
        across Africa to Sicily and then on to Naples.[30][31]
