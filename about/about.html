          Francesca is 21 years old and currently lives in Rome, Italy. She has lived there since January 2022 and loves it!
          She attends the University of Notre Dame and studies Computer Science, but currently is studying at John Cabot University. She is originally from Michigan, United States. 
          She loves to cook and bake, and she is a huge foodie! She is in love with traveling and trying new things. In Rome, she lives in Trastevere, the BEST place for food in Rome (in her opinion).
          She has two older siblings, both of which are culinary inspirations for her! Her sister creates recipes and has a food blog, and her brother loves to mix different cuisines to make unique dishes.
          She has two Italian parents, who have inspired her to explore Italy! She loves to share her aventures and cannot wait for you to read more.

          Ana Sofia is a 21 year old originally from Miami, Florida.  She studies Computer Science at 
          the University of Notre Dame, but is currently studying abroad in Rome at John Cabot University. 
          Just like Francesca, she is a big foodie and has enjoyed traveling around Europe trying all kinds of delicious dishes! 
          While she has enjoyed several meals throughout her travels, her favorite meal has been a Pici al ragù at the Osteria del Conte in Montepulciano.
          She is excited for everyone to see the food blog and hopes it is helpful to other traveling foodies!

      <h1>What We Do</h1>
      <hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;color:black;background-color:black">
      <p style="font-size:115%">
        We travel! We travel throughout Europe on the weekends and try new cuisines and experience new cultures.
        We taste new foods, especially those out of our comfort zone, to truly experience authentic food of the area.
        <br>
        <br>
        Before we taste them though we always snap a picture for the website! This way we can show you a true photo of the food, not a set-up or edited one.
        We eat the delicious food and report back to you guys what the dish is all about and how it represents the cuisine of the place.
        <br>
        <br>
        We share each and every thing we try! Enjoy!
